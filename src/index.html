                  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of optimizing
                  your website and online content to improve its visibility in
                  search engine results. It involves various techniques and
                  strategies to enhance your website's ranking in search engine
                  pages like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.

                <p>
                  SEO is crucial for businesses and website owners because it
                  helps increase organic (non-paid) traffic to your site, which
                  can lead to higher visibility, more visitors, and potential
                  customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Effective SEO can also improve the user experience on your
                  website and boost its credibility and trustworthiness.
